Welcome to `Ansible ecosystem documentation`.

Here you can find `How To` guides and `tutorials` for cross-project use cases within the Ansible ecosystem in this docsite.

If you're looking for documentation related to a specific Ansible project, visit the [ecosystem page](ecosystem.md).
You can explore Ansible projects and find links to the related documentation.

## Extending Ansible automation

Ansible is a programming language and runtime plus an entire ecosystem of projects that extends automation capabilities to a virtually unlimited set of use cases.

For example, the Ansible ecosystem gives you tools you need to:

* Create consistent, reliable playbooks for trusted automation
* Add automation to your `ci` workflows
* Build and use containerized control nodes
* Use community collections for automation
* Build a network mesh for executing automation jobs

The goal of the Ansible ecosystem documentation is to provide you with procedures for these various use cases.

## Share your automation knowledge

We love to learn too!
The Ansible community encourages everyone to share what they know about automation, whether it's writing playbooks or building automation solutions.
