## Extending Ansible automation

Ansible is a project ecosystem that extends automation capabilities to a wide range of use cases.
For example, the Ansible ecosystem provides tooling to:

* Create consistent, reliable playbooks for trusted automation
* Add automation to your workflows
* Build and use containerized control nodes
* Use community collections for automation
* Build a network mesh for executing automation jobs

The goal of the Ansible ecosystem documentation is to provide you with procedures for these various use cases.

## Share your automation knowledge

We love to learn too!
The Ansible community encourages everyone to share what they know about automation, whether it's writing playbooks or building automation solutions.
