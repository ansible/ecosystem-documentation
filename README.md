# ecosystem-documentation

This repository holds the source content for How-Tos and Tutorials using projects within the Ansible ecosystem.

ARCHIVED: We're archiving this repository because the ecosystem docsite basically just didn't happen.
There were good intentions and some solid ideas but cross-project documentation is a lot of work.
We've got plenty of other priorities and engineering work to do.
